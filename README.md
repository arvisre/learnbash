Hi, I'm Arvind. I've been a Windows System Administrator for quite a while now. Recently, I began learning Linux. I find Linux interesting and challenging. This repository consists of some simple scripts that I have been writing as part of my learning process. I mostly learn from the free educational content available on YouTube and other learning platforms. At the moment, most of the scripts I write are silly, but I look forward to writing useful scripts to automate tasks and becoming a Linux Systems Administrator.
